    "Relatively few features(8), especially compared to number of samples (4177).  Clearly listed as a classification problem.  Despite this I initially treated age/ring number as a continuous value, because I wanted to see how much I could discover on my own.  Obviously reading the subject page more closely would've saved me some work and frustration, but I did experiment with some interesting investigation methods, in the end."

Typically is determined by number of layers or \"rings\" in the shell, but this is cumbersome and obnoxious.  Personally speaking, I think a good model would help with monitoring farmed populations and conservation efforts."
